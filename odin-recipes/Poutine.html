    <h1> Poutine <h1> 

        <h2> Canadian Cuisine <h2> 

    <p> Poutine is a classic Canadian comfort food that started in Quebec and has since become famous around the world. At its core, it’s a simple dish made with crispy fries, squeaky cheese curds, and hot gravy poured over top. The contrast between crunchy, creamy, and savory is what makes it so satisfying. Even though it’s simple, getting the balance just right is what turns good poutine into great poutine
     Over time, poutine has evolved far beyond its humble beginnings. You can now find versions topped with pulled pork, mushrooms, smoked meat, or even butter chicken. Some people see it as late-night food, while others treat it as a serious culinary dish. Either way, poutine is a perfect example of how comfort food can become part of a country’s identity <p>
