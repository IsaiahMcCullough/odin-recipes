        <p>Moderate coffee consumption has been linked to improved cognitive function, including better alertness, attention, and reaction time. The caffeine in coffee stimulates the central nervous system, helping reduce mental fatigue and enhance short-term memory. Coffee also contains antioxidants that protect brain cells from oxidative stress. Over time, these effects may contribute to a lower risk of cognitive decline.

          Drinking coffee in moderation is associated with a reduced risk of several chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes and certain cardiovascular diseases. Bioactive compounds in coffee help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. Moderate intake has also been linked to improved liver health, with lower rates of liver disease reported among regular drinkers. When consumed without excessive sugar or cream, coffee can be a supportive part of a healthy diet </p>
